# Objective
Objective is to enhance ShopAssist AI, taking it to the next level as ShopAssist 2.0. In this we have to leverage the newly introduced 'function calling' feature to create a more streamlined and efficient chatbot to gain valuable experience in conversational AI and contribute to the development of innovative AI solutions. 

# Here are the tasks involved:
•	Integrate Function Calling API: Modify the existing architecture to leverage the Function Calling API's capabilities for improved performance. Scope out which layers can be removed and how the existing layers can be updated to handle the new approach.

•	Refine Conversation Flow: Enhance the chatbot's conversation flow by leveraging function calling. Make the interaction between the user and the chatbot more natural and dynamic.
